# BACH ‚Äì Breast Cancer Histology Image Classification

## üìå Project Overview

This project addresses the classification of breast cancer histology images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It aims to assist early cancer diagnosis by automating the classification of tissue images into four classes: **Normal, Benign, In Situ carcinoma,** and **Invasive carcinoma**.

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Since manual examination of histopathological images is time-consuming and subjective, deep learning offers a promising alternative to support and speed up diagnosis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenge: High-Resolution Images

The BACH dataset provides **very high-resolution images** (2048 √ó 1536 pixels), which posed a major challenge during model training. Most CNN architectures are designed for smaller input sizes (e.g., 128√ó128 or 224√ó224), so we had to **downscale images to 384√ó384**, resulting in **loss of important morphological features**. This affected the model's ability to distinguish between visually similar classes such as *In Situ* and *Normal*.

To address this, we explored the **sliding window technique**, where large images are split into smaller patches (e.g., 128√ó128) to preserve local information and improve feature extraction. Although this significantly improved the quality of input data, the number of generated patches per image (~16,500 per class) made training computationally intensive and **infeasible without GPU acceleration** (one epoch > 3 hours).

### ‚ûï Proposed Solution:
- Use **pretrained models** (e.g., ResNet, Inception-v3) with **transfer learning**
- Apply **patch-based classification** with **sliding windows** selectively on informative regions
- Use **adaptive architectures** like RANet for multi-scale input handling
